# 100days-of-coding-challenge

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

📌 Day 1: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern


📌 Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

📌 Day 3: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern

📌 Day 4: Dyanmic Array 

Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0

📌 Day 5: Left Rotation

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Once all the rotations have been performed, return the updated array.


📌 Day 6: String Similarity

Problem Statement: Given a string s, the task is to find the sum of the lengths of all its suffixes that start with the same character as the original string and match some prefix of the string s. The goal is to compute how similar the suffixes are to the prefix of the string.



📌 Day 7: Digital Frequency

Problem Statement: Given a string containing only digits, determine the frequency of each digit (0 through 9) in the string and print them in order from 0 to 9. Each frequency should be printed on a new line, corresponding to the digit's occurrence count in the string.



📌 Day 8: Calculate the Nth Term

Given the first few terms of a sequence, determine the Nth term in that sequence. The sequence follows a specific rule or formula that can be deduced from the provided terms. The task is to find and return the Nth term using that rule.


📌 Day 9: Power Calculation

Problem Statement:
Write a recursive function to calculate the result of raising a number x to the power n .


📌 Day 10: Permuting Two Arrays

Problem Statement:
Given two arrays of integers, A and B, and a number k, determine if there exists a permutation of the arrays such that for every index i, the sum of A[i] + B[i] is greater than or equal to k.


📌 Day 11: Array Reversal

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, reverse the elements of the array and return the reversed array.


📌 Day 12: Students Marks Sum

Problem Statement:
Given an array of student marks, calculate and return the sum of all the marks in the array.

📌 Day 13: Bitwise Operators

Problem Statement:
Given two integers, perform the following bitwise operations: AND, OR, and XOR. Return the results of each operation.

📌 Day 14: Array Manipulation

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of size n initialized to zeros and a list of operations. Each operation contains three integers: a, b, and k. For each operation, add the value k to all elements of the array between indices a and b (inclusive). Return the maximum value in the array after performing all the operations.

📌 Day 15: Mini-Max Sum

Problem Statement:
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then, print the respective minimum and maximum sums.
