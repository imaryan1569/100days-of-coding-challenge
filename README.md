# 100days-of-coding-challenge

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

📌 Day 1: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern


📌 Day 2: Basic Data Type

Problem Statement: each element of a list or array should be printed on a new line in the exact order they were received as input.

📌 Day 3: 2D Array DS

Problem Statement:Given a 6 x 6 2D array,arr, an hourglass is a subset of values with indices falling in the following pattern

📌 Day 4: Dyanmic Array 

Problem Statement:Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, with n empty arrays, all zero-indexed. Declare an integer,last Answer, and initialize it to 0


📌 Day 5: Left Rotation

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Once all the rotations have been performed, return the updated array.


📌 Day 6: String Similarity

Problem Statement: Given a string s, the task is to find the sum of the lengths of all its suffixes that start with the same character as the original string and match some prefix of the string s. The goal is to compute how similar the suffixes are to the prefix of the string.



📌 Day 7: Digital Frequency

Problem Statement: Given a string containing only digits, determine the frequency of each digit (0 through 9) in the string and print them in order from 0 to 9. Each frequency should be printed on a new line, corresponding to the digit's occurrence count in the string.



📌 Day 8: Calculate the Nth Term

Given the first few terms of a sequence, determine the Nth term in that sequence. The sequence follows a specific rule or formula that can be deduced from the provided terms. The task is to find and return the Nth term using that rule.
